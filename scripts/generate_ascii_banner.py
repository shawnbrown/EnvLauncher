"""ASCII Art Generation Script


PYTHON LOGO:

The original Python logo was designed by Tim Parkin and is trademarked
by the Python Software Foundation.

An ASCII art version of the logo was designed by Matthew Barber and is
licensed under CC-BY-4.0. Matthew Barber's ASCII version was used as a
reference for the logo I created here. You can find Matthew Barber's
version online at:

ASCII FONT:

The "python powered" text was generated with FIGlet using the Jazmine
font (jazmine.flf).
