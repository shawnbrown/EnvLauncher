# Source Files for Icons

This folder contains SVG source files for the EnvLauncher icon.


### GNOME Integration

The EnvLauncher icon should follow GNOME Project's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for icons and artwork
(see [Icons and Artwork](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/icons-and-artwork.html)
and [Creating Icons](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/icon-design.html)):

* Full-color application icons should be 128x128px SVG images.
* They should also be usable when scaled down to 64x64px and 32x32px.
* Application icons should only include details that are presentable at 64Ã—64px resolution--finer details should be avoided.
* Ideally, the icon should have a unique silhouette.
* Use the **GNOME icon template** ([gnome-template.svg](./gnome-template.svg)) to establish the size and position of icon features.
* Icons should be designed with a simple orthogonal view (not with a realistic or isometric perspective).
* Shadows can be drawn internally, with the light source coming from straight above.
* Icons should use the **GNOME icon color palette** ([gnome-colors.svg](./gnome-colors.svg)).
* Symbolic icons should be 16x16px SVG images and can be scaled by multiples of 16 (32x32, 64x64, 128x128).
